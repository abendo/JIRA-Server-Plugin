[ First things first: ]

0. Install the Atlassian SDK
1. Create a Hello-World Plugin project
2. Modify the plugin
3. Modify using QuickReload
 
** You have successfully created an Atlassian Plugin! __

 [ Here are the SDK commands you'll use immediately: ] 

* atlas-run   -- installs this plugin into the product and starts it on localhost
* atlas-debug -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* atlas-help  -- prints description for all commands in the SDK

The goal of this will be to create a plugin that provides gadgets. Plugin is an app that can be
installed in JIRA software while gadget will be just the representation. 

This is a JIRA Server plugin.
The plugin consists of gadget which will show some data (in my case) in chart format (line / pie). Unfortunately there is no good documentation
on how to develop those plugins so I hope this is a bit helpful.

In the 'atlassian-plugin.xml' file is the XML file of the plugin. There we pack the gadgets and all other resources for each gadget. 

'linegadget.xml' and 'piegadget.xml' are the XML files of the gadgets. There can add more filters and customize it better. For more information
check the file as is well commented.

In js folder are the javascript files where all the functions are implemented. 

'myPlugin.js' consists of some common code for both gadgets.

'linechart.js' has specific code for 'linegadget.xml' and same for the other. Both files are commented.

'css' folder is empty as there is no need to write for the look of the gadget. JIRA Server does it :D.

'java' files are generated when you create your project.
